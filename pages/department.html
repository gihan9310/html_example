      <p>
        Anthropology, as a distinct field of study under social sciences, has been developing a unique identity within the global education system. Therefore, the demand for higher education is continuously increasing. As a result, the Department of Anthropology has earned a very high recognition for its study programmes. We teach and conduct research in physical and cultural anthropology. Although few universities teach cultural anthropology the university of Sri Jayewardenepura in the one and only Sri Lankan university that offers a special degree in programme consist of cultural as well as physical anthropology.

      <p>The Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice is a newly established department in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and to-date, the one and only department of this nature, in Sri Lanka. Nearly three decades ago, with the initiative and guidance of our late senior professor Nandasena Ratnapala, the Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Degree in Criminology was introduced to students by the Department of Sociology and Anthropology.</p>
