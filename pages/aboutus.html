        <h3>Introduction to the Department</h3>

        <p>The Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice is a newly established department in the Faculty of
            Humanities and Social Sciences and to-date, the one and only department of this nature, in Sri Lanka. Nearly
            three decades ago, with the initiative and guidance of our late senior professor Nandasena Ratnapala, the
            Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Degree in Criminology was introduced to students by the Department of Sociology
            and Anthropology.

            During the mid-1980s, the late Senior Professor Nandasena Ratnapala, the Professor of Sociology and
            Anthropology, was the key figure in introducing this novel subject to the Sri Lankan University curriculum.
            As young behavioral and empirical social science, Criminology and Criminal Justice mainly focus on crime and
            crime related social and legal settings. The prime objective of this multi-disciplinary field of study is to
            prevent and control crime in order to uplift the quality of individuals’ social lives.

            Initially, Criminology was taught as a fourth-year special subject combined with the subject “Social
            Problems” by the Ex-Prison Commissioner General late Mr. J.P. Delgoda, as a visiting lecturer under the
            guidance of Professor Ratnapala. For the first time, under the Headship of Senior Lecturer E.K. Ganihigama
            and with the consultation of Retired Deputy Inspector General of Police, Dr. S.P. Dharmadasa, as well as
            with the patronage of the then residential representative of the Asian Foundation Mr. Richard Guyer,
            commenced the four-year special degree programme in Criminology and Criminal Justice, during the academic
            year 1985/86. At the time, the Administrative Vice-Chancellor of the University of Illinois Professor
            Richard Ward was instrumental in initiating the degree programme at the Department of Sociology and
            Anthropology.

            With the continuous guidance of Professor Ratnapala, numerous postgraduate diplomas as well as degrees were
            commenced. Owing to its applicability, these postgraduate programmes in Criminology and Criminal Justice
            have been widely accepted especially, by the employees of the Department of Police, Prison, Probation,
            Customs, Immigration and Emigration as well as the Legal sector. Concurrently, M.A., M.Phil. and Ph.D.
            degree programmes were introduced under the direction of Professor Ratnapala. In the early 2000s, a
            Criminology and Criminal Justice Diploma was introduced mainly to address the educational needs of
            non-graduate employees of the Police, Prison, Probation, Customs, Immigration and Emigration, etc.
            Presently, the Police Department has sponsored their own employees to follow this programme as a way of
            enhancing the quality of the police service.

            In 2012, considering the vital necessity of this new discipline of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Senior
            Lecturer Dr. R.N. Sunil made a formal request to establish a separate department to the Faculty of
            Humanities and Social Sciences, under the Headship of Professor M.W. Jayasundara. Although it has taken a
            long period to obtain the official approval of the University Grants Commission, in 2016 the authority to
            set up a separate Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice was granted.

            Besides these existing programs, B.A Special Degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice was commenced in
            English Medium for the first time with 6 undergraduates. There are 80 undergraduates registered for the
            Special Degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice. Furthermore, one year M.A Degree in Criminology and
            Criminal Justice is to be introduced in the near future in accordance with Sri Lankan Quality Framework.

            In the wake of this historical creation, Professor Sampath Amarathunga, the Vice-Chancellor, Professor P.
            Athukorala and Senior Lecturer Lasantha Nawaratne, the past and present Deans of the Faculty of Humanities
            and Social Sciences, Senior Lecturers W.M. Dhanapala, Udayakumara Amarasinghe, Dr. R.B.N. Sunil, and Dr.
            Nerangi Wijewardena have been very supportive and cooperative toward this endeavor. Also, all the colleagues
            of the University have been very keen to see us functioning as an independent Department and must remember
            all of them with profound gratitude. Not forgetting the Criminology undergraduates who have been waiting
            impatiently to see their Department becoming an independent should also be acknowledged with affection.

        <h3>Goals</h3>

        <p>The Sri Lankan criminal Justice system is consist of various apparatus and its smooth functioning and
            coordination with one another will definitely be a positive step toward the establishment of a law-abiding
            Sri Lankan society.
            In order to achieve this goal, educating the officers of the criminal justice system is an essential
            requirement. We as the academic members of this Department solely believe that meeting their educational
            requirements are a priority in our agenda. Considering their professional needs, and developing various
            educational programmes to suit their preferences is our intention. This will definitely be a positive step
            taken to uplift the quality of the Sri Lankan Justice System.

            The prime intention of Criminology is to control and prevent crimes. Too often we hear various heinous
            criminal incidents committed against children as well as women in our society. It is an essential necessity
            to address this situation with practical measures in order to make our society safe and sound for these
            innocent victims. Women and child-friendly policy making and their proper implementation is extremely
            essential and we as the academic members are ready to be active partners of this much needed project.

            As revealed by the statistics related to population, there is a growing tendency of elderly population even
            in our country too. This trend may set a new crime wave against the aging people and it is not too early to
            address this to avert a grave situation in time to come. Taking into the elderly needs and ensure their
            safety in the society can be done from a criminological perspective so that they can have a peace of mind
            and enjoy the eve of their lives.
            According to current state policies, Information Technology is certain to dominate the Sri Lankan future.
            Within such a context, crimes, deviant acts and abusing can be increased more than traditional criminal
            acts. Therefore, the Sri Lankan criminal justice system should be prepared to take up this challenge. This
            national encounter has to be addressed by the university level and the only suitable Department for this
            gigantic task is the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Facilitating the required training and
            introducing and implementing the relevant policies in order to take the necessary steps in curbing the wave
            of cyber-crime.

            With the development of Criminology, many related subfields have been developed. Environmental Criminology
            may play a vital role under present conditions. Although there are enough laws and regulation to safe guard
            the environment, yet many crimes are being committed against the mother-nature. Reported natural disasters
            confirm that environmental harm and degradation are man-made and strict measures have to be taken in
            implementing the existing laws and regulations. Based on facts revealed through scientific sources,
            appropriate measures have to be taken immediately in order to minimize the future natural disasters and
            maximize individual safety. We the academic members are keen to be part of these projects as a fulfillment
            of our academic obligation.</p>
